##  Visual novel "The Mystery of Chimney Rock"

Visual novel, based on the book "The Mystery of Chimney Rock" by Edward Packard. Made as part of the 2 days student hackathon organised by Irkutsk state university .

## About the project

1) Backgrounds were generated by Midjorney AI (midjorney.com) and after upscaled with Topaz Gigapixel AI
2) Since neural networks do not always give completely realistic results, it was decided to stylize the game as a project completely written by neural networks.
3) 19 Endings: 18 official, one as an easter egg
4) For development we used RenPy. 
5) Undertale-style character voices
6) Every character uses own font during speaking
7) Language: Russian
